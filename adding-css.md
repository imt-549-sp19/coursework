# Adding CSS style

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that we use to alter the appearance of our HTML pages. A CSS file (known as a **stylesheet**) consists of a set of formatting rules. The browser interprets and applies these rules when it renders your web page.

CSS is immensely powerful and flexible. You can control nearly every aspect of an element's appearance, including its overall placement on the page. To give you some idea of just how much control you have, check out the [examples in the CSS Zen Garden](http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/). Every one of those examples uses the exact same HTML page, but they all look completely different because each one uses a different CSS stylesheet.
