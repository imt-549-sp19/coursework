# CSS Frameworks

In the [Adding Some Style](adding-css.html) and [Responding to the Device](responsive.html) tutorials, you learned how to write style rules that change the appearance of your web pages. Although you could implement a entire site with only custom style rules, most professionals build upon a well-tested CSS framework instead. The framework normalizes browser default styling, applies consistent and attractive formatting to all HTML elements, and defines several style classes you can use for common UI components (badges, alerts, cards, responsive navigation bars, tabs, drop-down buttons, tool tips and popovers, sliders, switches, carousels, etc.). You can then add your own custom rules on top of the framework to tweak the default framework formatting.

A CSS framework is just a stylesheet with a bunch of rules that someone else wrote for you, and some accompanying JavaScript for the interactive features. There's nothing magic about it. You can look at the stylesheet and see all the rules that are defined in there, and it's all stuff you could have written yourself. But those rules have been crafted by professionals and tested on a wide array of browsers to ensure consistent results, so it's a good idea to build on top of them.

## Popular CSS Frameworks

There are several popular CSS frameworks to choose from. All of them provide beautiful formatting of HTML elements, pre-defined responsive multi-column layout grids that work on all browsers, and all the common UI elements you see on most web sites.

### Bootstrap

The most commonly-used CSS framework on the web is Bootstrap. It was originally created at Twitter to enforce some consistency amongst their internal tools, but after they released it as an open-source project in 2011, it became very widely used. That wide use has benefits and drawbacks: it's very well tested, documented, and supported, but it's also so prevalent that it's default look has become clich√©. Thankfully, it's rather easy to customize Bootstrap with your own fonts, colors, sizing, etc.
